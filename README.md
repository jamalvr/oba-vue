# oba-vue
Vue application with routing for OBA API data. In this assignment I re-made my existing 'Web App From Scratch' application. 
Instead of mostly vanilla javascript, I re-made it using Vue.js. My goal is to learn Vue basics and see what the differences are between mostly Vanilla JS and Vue. Both of them should have their pros & cons.
